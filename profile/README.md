Intelligent agents that are:
- **Complex**: human-like intelligent behavior results from an interplay of various types of inference and reasoning; such as perceptual & sensory inference, task planning, preference calucaltion, goal reasoning, analogical reasoning etc. We study agent architectures that integrate these inference methods in a single, cohesive, system.  
- **Collaborative**: agents that can partner with humans need computational models of human decision making, problem solving, and learning. These models should be 'usable' by agents' decision making processes. We study how human models from psychology, cognitive science, behavior economics and other social sciences can brought into intelligent agent systems.
