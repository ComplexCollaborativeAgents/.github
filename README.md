Effective human-agent collaboration in the real world requires a systems lens. An agent must understand the world, make productive decisions given its observations, and act to pursue its goals. In addition, it must also
exchange information with human partners through natural modalities. I take a four-pronged approach towards developing collaborative agents. First, I draw upon the insights in cognitive science about the nature of the human mind to build
human-like agent systems that have multiple intelligent capabilities - vision, learning, reasoning, planning, task execution,
dialog etc. Second, I adapt descriptive models of human decisions, behavior, and learning in social sciences into prescrip-
tive models to be used within an agentâ€™s decision making processes making it human-aware. Third, I embed agents in in-
terfaces and embodiments to study the principles of natural collaborative human-AI interaction. Finally, I evaluate agent
performance using social science methods and human-centered metrics (e.g, flexibility, acceptability). This approach goes
beyond benchmark datasets and computation-centric metrics (e.g, accuracy
